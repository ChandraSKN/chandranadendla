<p>In the busy city of Mumbai, life never stopped. The sun was going down, and the sky turned orange and purple. All around, people hurried home, street vendors packed up, and cars honked in traffic. In the middle of this rush stood <strong>Sarasvati Siksha University (SSU)</strong>, a place where students studied hard and hoped for a bright future.</p>
<p>Gowtham, a young man with a restless spirit, found himself in the dimly lit depths of the
university’s car park. As he sat in his car, the world outside faded into obscurity, shielding him
from the clamour of Mumbai's relentless energy. Lost in his thoughts, he was startled by the
shrill ring of his phone. Its screen displayed the name 'Ravi,' and without hesitation, Gowtham
answered.</p>
<p>'I am coming, give me ten minutes,' Gowtham replied hurriedly, his voice laced with urgency.
Ravi's terse response, 'Come fast, we need to move the body,' sent a chill down Gowtham's
spine.</p>
<p>With nimble fingers, Gowtham accessed a clandestine app on his phone, an indispensable tool
that granted him control over the college's security systems. A swift click of a switch button
within the app triggered a notification, 'Car park access granted.' The gates groaned open,
allowing him passage. Exiting his car, Gowtham sprinted toward the door, his eyes fixated on
his watch, the minutes ticking away relentlessly.</p>
<p>Through the labyrinthine corridors, Gowtham navigated, his watch screen continuously
swiped, as if trying to manipulate time itself. Finally, he arrived at a dimly lit location,
illuminated only by feeble emergency lights scattered along the walls. The atmosphere was
heavy with anticipation as Gowtham tapped his watch, causing a small red light to emanate,
accompanied by a subtle beep. In the soft glow, a young woman emerged, her silhouette hinting
at a familiar figure. Without hesitation, she rushed towards Gowtham, enveloping him in a tight
embrace. It was Shreya, the object of Gowtham's affection. In that moment, their worlds
converged, offering solace amidst the turmoil that awaited them.</p>
<p>Soon, three more figures emerged from the shadows. Ravi, Divya, and Naresh, their faces
etched with a mixture of worry and trepidation. As Gowtham approached them, his voice
strained with concern, he called out to Ravi, demanding to know what had transpired. Divya
interjected, her words laced with theatrical flair, 'Murder,' she uttered with a hushed intensity,
the weight of the unknown heavy upon them. Immediately, Ravi interjected, casting doubt on
Divya's assumption. "We don't know yet," he replied with a hint of scepticism in his voice.
Divya's retort came swiftly, laced with sarcasm. "Oh, in what world does a person choose uni
theatre to die naturally?" she quipped, her words dripping with irony. Ravi responded with a
bemused look, silently acknowledging the absurdity of the situation.</p>
<p>Curiosity burned within him, and Gowtham pressed Ravi for an explanation on why he had
decided not to involve the police. The silence that followed spoke volumes, each member of
the group exchanging furtive glances. Suspicion gripped Gowtham, and he turned to Shreya,seeking answers. "Shreya, what happened?" he implored, his voice tinged with a mix of
concern and frustration.</p>
<p>Shreya hesitated for a moment, her gaze shifting between Gowtham and Ravi. Finally, she
mustered the courage to speak. "G, actually..." Her voice trailed off, and she looked towards
Ravi, urging him to reveal the truth. Gowtham's gaze intensified, a flicker of anger creeping
into his voice. "Ravi, you tell me, “He demanded, his tone laced with a sense of urgency.
Ravi began to mumble, struggling to find the right words. "Actually, there was a knife... and
fingerprints... and footprints..." he managed to utter, his voice faltering. Divya's eyes narrowed
as she locked her gaze onto Ravi, her accusatory tone cutting through the tension. "It's your
fault. Dad warned me about your irresponsible behaviour. You are going to drag us all down,"
she asserted, her words seething with resentment.</p>
<p>Ravi's voice trembled as he responded, shocked by his sister's revelation. "Did Dad really say
that?" he whispered; his voice filled with disbelief. Divya's sarcastic smirk remained firmly in
place as she replied, "More or less, the same meaning." Ravi's confusion deepened as he
questioned Divya's motives. "If you knew I was trouble, why did you follow me?" he asked,
his voice tinged with hurt. Divya's retort was swift and cutting. "I wanted to know what you
were hiding," she stated firmly.</p>
<p>Ravi insisted, "I didn't hide anything from you." Divya, undeterred, fired back, "What about
the ice cream I left in the fridge? You ate it." Ravi's face contorted in disbelief. "I didn't eat it.
Ask Mom if you want," he protested. Divya, unyielding, shot back, "Mom always supports
you. I know." Gowtham observed the exchange with a suspicious gaze, silently keeping his
own secret about devouring the ice cream.</p>
<p>Growing impatient, Gowtham intervened, demanding clarity from the group. "Come on, guys.
Can someone please tell me what happened?" Naresh, who had been silent until now, finally
spoke up. "I think we messed up," he confessed, his voice filled with a mixture of fear and
guilt. "I don't know what happened exactly, but I saw Ravi holding the knife next to the body."
Ravi interrupted, countering Naresh's claim. "I saw Shreya holding the knife and entering the
theater hall," he insisted, his voice tinged with accusation. Shreya, frustration evident in her
tone, interjected, "For God's sake, how many times do I have to tell you? That was not a knife;
it was my hair clip." Divya came in between and said, "I didn't do anything, I just followed
Ravi." Everyone looked at Divya angrily.</p>
<p>Gowtham silenced the heated exchange, his voice cutting through the tension. "So, what are
you all trying to say?" he asked, his gaze shifting between his friends. Naresh spoke up once
again, revealing a troubling truth. "The whole dead body is covered in all four of our
fingerprints and footprints," he confessed. "If we inform anyone about it, no one is going to
trust us."</p>
<p>As Naresh was explaining their involvement, Divya attempted to speak up, but each time,
someone interrupted her. Frustration building, she finally shouted, "Guys, the dead body!"
Everyone turned their attention to Divya, eager to hear what she had to say. With a trembling
voice, she continued, "The dead body is missing. “All eyes darted towards the spot where Divya
pointed, only to find an empty space. Surprisingly, there was no trace of the corpse, but the
entire floor was splattered with blood. Panic gripped the group as they realized the evidencewas vanishing before their eyes. Ravi's hesitation to involve the police suddenly made sense to
Gowtham. Ravi frantically searched for the murder weapon, but it was nowhere to be found.
He understood that Ravi's reluctance was driven by their participation in the upcoming SSP
competition.</p>
<p>Gowtham and the rest joined the search, scouring every corner of the scene. The tension in the
air was palpable as they desperately looked for any sign of the missing body or weapon. The
dimly lit theatre hall added an eerie ambiance to the search, the shadows playing tricks on their
minds. Each creaking sound and flickering light heightened their anxiety.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chaos, Divya's fear-stricken voice cut through, "I think we should leave. It's
getting late, and we've spent too much time at the crime scene." Her suggestion hung in the air,
and everyone contemplated the consequences of staying any longer. The fear of being caught,
of the truth unravelling, weighed heavily on their minds.</p>
<p>Ravi pondered the situation and voiced his concern. "What about our footprints? If there's no
body or weapon, our footprints will be the only evidence to file a case against us. We won't
have any proof to defend ourselves." Naresh, who had been quiet until now, spoke up with a
mysterious tone, his voice filled with an unexpected suggestion. "We should clean up the
evidence."</p>
<p>Ravi readily agreed, understanding the urgency of the situation. They couldn't afford to leave
any trace behind, any shred of evidence that could link them to the crime. The group's collective
decision was made, acknowledging the risks they faced. They knew they had to clean up the
crime scene to eliminate any trace of their involvement.</p>
<p>One by one, they retrieved cleaning tools from the theatre hall's storage room. Gowtham
grabbed a wet mop, its bristles dripping with water, while Ravi took a dry mop, ready to absorb
any remaining stains. Naresh and Shreya armed themselves with cloths and cleaning spray,
their determined expressions masked their fear. Divya, holding a dusting tool in her trembling
hand, tried to keep up her composure amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>As the group assembled with their respective tools, Ravi could not resist a sarcastic remark
directed at Divya, trying to lighten the heavy atmosphere. "What will you do with that?" he
asked, pointing at the dusting tool. Divya, despite the tension, retorted in the same sarcastic
tone, a touch of dark humour in her voice, "Sorry, brother, it's my first murder... I mean, the
first murder I've ever seen."</p>
<p>With a mixture of trepidation and determination, they set to work. The sound of mops sweeping
across the bloodstained floor echoed through the empty theatre hall. The pungent smell of
cleaning chemicals mingled with the metallic scent of blood, creating an odd combination that
permeated the air. Each member of the group scrubbed and wiped; their movements almost
robotic as they tried to erase any trace of their presence.</p>
<p>The task felt never-ending, the minutes stretching into hours as they meticulously cleaned the
bloodstains, ensuring not a single spot remained. The intensity of their focus was unwavering,
fuelled by the fear of discovery. Every sound, every creaking floorboard, sent a jolt of anxiety
through their veins.As they continued their frantic efforts, a newfound sense of unity emerged among the group.</p>
<p>Despite their conflicting emotions and accusations, they had no choice but to rely on each other
to escape the clutches of the impending doom. Each stroke of the mop, each spray of the
cleaning solution, became a symbolic act of trust and solidarity.</p>
<p>The minutes turned into hours, and exhaustion weighed heavily on their shoulders. Drops of
sweat rolled down their foreheads, mixing with the remnants of blood on their faces. But they
persisted, determined to leave no trace behind. The theatre hall slowly transformed from a
crime scene to a sterile, sanitized space, devoid of any evidence of their involvement.
Finally, as the last remnants of blood were wiped away, a sense of relief washed over them.
They had done their best to clean up the mess they had unwittingly become a part of. But the
underlying unease remained, lingering like a shadow in the back of their minds. The missing
body, the vanishing evidence—it was a mystery they could not escape.</p>
<p>Exhausted and emotionally drained, they gathered their cleaning tools, careful to leave no trace
of their presence behind. As they prepared to leave the theatre hall, the weight of their actions
settled upon them. They had tampered with a crime scene, hidden the truth, and embarked on
a dangerous path. The consequences of their choices loomed over them, threatening to unravel
their lives.</p>
<p>With heavy hearts, they made their way out of the theatre hall, each step filled with uncertainty.
The darkness of the night outside mirrored the uncertainty that now engulfed their lives. They
had crossed a line, and there was no turning back.</p>
<p>As they dispersed into the night, the events of that evening remained etched in their minds. The
murder, the missing body, the collective decision to clean up the evidence—they were bound
together by secrets and guilt. The mystery had just begun, and they were entangled in a web of
intrigue and danger that would test their loyalty and resilience.</p>
<p>Little did they know that their actions had set in motion a series of events that would lead them
deeper into the darkness, unravelling a web of secrets and lies that would threaten not only
their friendships but also their very lives. The truth was out there, waiting to be discovered, and
they were about to embark on a journey that would change everything they thought they knew.
And so, with hearts heavy and minds filled with anticipation, they stepped into the unknown,
ready to face the consequences of their actions and delve deeper into the intricate puzzle of the
first murder they had ever encountered. The game had just begun, and the stakes were higher
than they could have ever imagined</p>

<h3><strong>Chapter 2: The Day We Met</strong></h3>
<p>Perfect crimes may seem flawless as long as they remain secret. However, even the most
meticulously planned schemes could unravel if those involved fail to remain silent in times of
adversity. Now, the question arises: can these five individuals truly keep their secret? Are they
genuinely as close as they appear?</p>
<p>To uncover the answers, we must trace back to the day they first met, the inception of the SSP
Club—the origin of their journey.</p>
<p>Eight months prior, these individuals, excluding Divya and Ravi, had no connection to one
another. It was a single decision made by Rama Prabha, the head of the Science Group at
Sarasvati Siksha University (SSU), that would forever alter their lives.</p>
<p>In an effort to promote practical and application-oriented learning and nurture young talent,
Rama Prabha launched a program known as the SSP Club—Special Science Projects Club.
This initiative aimed to select 150 students from colleges across India. Only five of these
students would secure a coveted spot in the club, entitling them to a scholarship that would
offer them to study in any top universities like Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and Stanford.
Furthermore, these fortunate individuals would also have the unique opportunity to contribute
to India's esteemed defence project, Kavach, working closely with the national government.
However, gaining a spot in the top five required successfully navigating three rounds of
rigorous selection.</p>
<p><strong>The Announcement</strong></p>
<p>The sun cast a warm glow over the sprawling campus of Sarasvati Siksha University (SSU),
an institution steeped in history and renowned for its rich academic tradition. The old university
buildings stood tall, their grand architecture a testament to the knowledge that had been
cultivated within their walls for generations. SSU boasted state-of-the-art laboratories,
advanced research facilities, and a faculty of highly talented professors who nurtured young
minds with their wisdom and expertise.</p>
<p>On a bright morning, the open hall of SSU buzzed with anticipation as 150 aspiring scientists
and innovators gathered. Their eyes sparkled with hope, each carrying dreams of making a
mark in the world of science. This was the day they would meet Rama Prabha, the esteemed
head of the Science Group at SSU and the driving force behind the SSP Club.</p>
<p>Rama Prabha, a distinguished scientist with a passion for nurturing young talent, stepped onto
the stage. Her presence commanded attention, and a hushed silence fell over the hall. As she
began to speak, her voice carried a sense of authority combined with genuine warmth.</p>
<p>"Welcome, aspiring scientists and innovators," Rama Prabha's words echoed through the hall,
resonating with a contagious enthusiasm. "Today, we embark on a journey that will push the
boundaries of your scientific abilities and ignite your creative spirits. The SSP Club
competition is not just a platform for showcasing your skills; it is an opportunity to transform
yourselves into true scientific visionaries."</p>
<p>She paused, allowing her words to sink in, as the participants leaned forward, captivated by her
presence."You have been chosen from among thousands of students across India for your exceptional
talent and dedication to the pursuit of knowledge. The SSP Club will test your scientific
prowess, critical thinking, teamwork, and innovative spirit."</p>
<p>Rama Prabha's eyes scanned the eager faces before her, taking in the anticipation and
determination radiating from the students.</p>
<p><strong>"Let me take you through the three stages that await you in this remarkable journey."</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Stage 1: Group Project Challenge - "The Enigma Experiment" "In this stage, you will
form groups of five," Rama Prabha continued, her voice filled with excitement. "Each
group will be assigned a unique scientific problem, known as 'The Enigma Experiment.'
These problems have been carefully designed to challenge your intellect and creativity.
Your task is to collaborate, design, and execute an innovative experiment that addresses
the problem and presents a groundbreaking solution. You will have a limited timeframe
to conduct your experiments, analyse data, and prepare a comprehensive project report.
Remember, teamwork is key as you learn to leverage each other's strengths and work
towards a common goal."</li>
</ol>
<p>The participants exchanged glances, their minds already buzzing with ideas, as they
contemplated the possibilities that lay ahead.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Stage 2: Face-to-Face Rounds - "Scientific Showdown" "The top-performing groups
from Stage 1 will advance to the Face-to-Face Rounds," Rama Prabha announced, her
voice brimming with intensity. "These rounds will be a true test of your scientific
acumen and problem-solving skills. You will find yourselves in a specially designed
laboratory setting, facing real-life scientific scenarios. From identifying unknown
substances to solving complex equations and performing intricate laboratory
techniques, you must showcase your scientific knowledge under pressure. It is not only
about individual brilliance but also about effective communication, collaboration, and
teamwork. Renowned scientists and industry experts will be observing and judging
each challenge, assessing your ability to apply scientific principles effectively in a
competitive environment."</li>
</ol>
<p>The room filled with a mix of determination and nervous anticipation as the participants
absorbed the magnitude of the challenges that awaited them.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stage 3: Individual Prototype Showcase - "Innovation Expo" "Forthe final stage," Rama
Prabha continued, her voice filled with anticipation, "the competition will shift to
individual performance, where each participant will have the opportunity to showcase
their unique scientific talents and innovations."</li>
</ol>
<p>She paused, a smile gracing her lips as she observed the enthusiasm and curiosity in the eyes
of the participants.</p>
<p>"In the Individual Prototype Showcase, you will have the freedom to explore any area of
science that aligns with your interests and expertise. This is your chance to delve deep into
your chosen scientific field and develop your own prototype—an embodiment of your
creativity and scientific prowess. Your prototypes will be presented at the grand 'Innovation
Expo,' a gathering attended by esteemed scientists, industry leaders, and the public. Theevaluation criteria will focus on innovation, practicality, scientific rigor, and the potential
impact your prototype can have on society."</p>
<p>The participants exchanged excited whispers, their minds already buzzing with ideas for their
individual prototypes, envisioning the possibilities and impact their creations could make.
"I have faith in each and every one of you," Rama Prabha concluded, her voice filled with pride
and encouragement. "You have been handpicked for this extraordinary opportunity because
you possess the passion, talent, and dedication that can shape the future of scientific
exploration. Embrace this journey, learn from one another, and let your scientific spirits soar."</p>
<p>As Rama Prabha stepped off the stage, a renewed sense of purpose filled the hall. The
participants could feel the weight of responsibility and the magnitude of the competition. They
knew that SSU, with its rich history and exceptional resources, had provided them with the
platform they needed to shine.</p>
<p><strong>The Dinner</strong></p>
<p>After Rama Prabha's speech, the open hall reverberated with a cacophony of voices as the
participants engaged in excited chatter. Anticipation and nervous energy filled the atmosphere,
creating a palpable buzz. However, the sudden interruption of Dr Vishnu Vardhan, the
psychology professor, brought an immediate hush over the room. Dr Vardhan, a commanding
presence with his tall stature, broad shoulders, and muscular build, stepped forward, casting a
shadow of silence over the crowd.</p>
<p>"Sorry, everyone," Dr Vardhan announced, his voice cutting through the noise. "The
competition has been cancelled." A wave of surprise and disappointment washed over the
participants as they turned their attention to the professor.</p>
<p>Dr Vardhan, wearing a peculiar smile, continued, "But let me tell you, this statement can be
true for anyone of you at any moment if I catch you making any mistakes." He paused for a
moment, letting his words sink in. "I will share an interesting quote that might give you clarity
about your stay here for the next nine months: 'For surviving a hundred times, you need to be
lucky a hundred times. But to die, you just need to be unlucky once.'"</p>
<p>His words hung heavy in the air, and the room fell into a contemplative silence. Dr Vardhan's
gaze swept across the room as he continued, "SSU is not here to make your individual futures
bright; that responsibility lies with your parents. We are here to make the world bright, and for
that, I will not hesitate to push you all into the darkness. I know some of you might think I am
a sadist, questioning how one's behaviour can be used to judge their talent. But believe me, I
am much more than what you think. This is an opportunity that has the power to change your
lives. So, limit your actions, not your thoughts."</p>
<p>The weight of Dr Vardhan's words settled upon the participants, leaving them with a mix of
uncertainty and determination. They understood that their journey at SSU would be
challenging, and that success would require more than just scientific knowledge and skills.
Dr Vishnu Vardhan concluded by reminding everyone to dress appropriately and join the
dinner, emphasizing the importance of maintaining good behaviour throughout the evening.The evening arrived, and one by one, the participants made their way into the hall around 7:00
PM. Among the crowd, a lady dressed in a stunning red long dress caught everyone's attention.
It was none other than Shreya, who seemed to have a group of admirers following her every
move. On the other hand, Naresh, the unnoticed figure, entered the hall in an old suit that looked
older than the university itself.</p>
<p>While Shreya became the centre of attention, male students like Gowtham and Vivek engaged
in a silent competition to impress the female students. Gowtham, dressed impeccably as a
gentleman, caught the eyes of many, but he seemed disinterested in the beauty competition
unfolding before him. Instead, he quietly sipped a fruit punch in a corner. Vivek, on the other
hand, was determined to eliminate his competitors before the start of the first round. He took
out a small butterfly drone from his pocket and set it flying. Using his smartwatch, Vivek
maneuverer the drone to fly directly over the students' eyes, causing them to drop their drinks
onto the professor. Vishnu Vardhan, known for his observant nature, noticed the students'
actions but did not respond immediately, silently adding their names to his list of potential
troublemakers.</p>
<p>Growing frustrated, Vivek decided to take his actions further and directly target Vishnu
Vardhan. He directed the butterfly drone to fly over Naresh as he was about to pass by Vishnu
Vardhan. Vivek pressed the up arrow on his watch, causing the drone to fly high into the air,
and then adjusted its angle to make it swoop down towards Naresh. As the butterfly flew over
Naresh's eyes, he shook and accidentally flipped his juice glass. However, Gowtham, who
happened to be standing between Naresh and Vishnu Vardhan, shielded the professor from the
flying juice, causing it to land on Gowtham instead. Vishnu Vardhan felt the impact and saw
the juice stains on Gowtham's coat, leading him to take notice of Naresh's involvement.
Just as Vishnu Vardhan was about to confront Gowtham, a mysterious man in a black suit, long
hair, and a trimmed beard approached them. He placed his hand on Gowtham's shoulder,
turning him around, and discreetly sprayed something on Gowtham's coat. When Gowtham
finally turned to face Vishnu Vardhan, the professor was surprised to find no trace of juice
stains on the coat. Intrigued, Vishnu Vardhan left the scene, leaving Gowtham and Naresh
relieved. They looked at the man in gratitude and curiosity, asking how he managed to remove
the stains and who he was. The man introduced himself as Ravi and explained that he used his
"Vanish Spray," which contained ethyl alcohol and chelating agents to break down and remove
the metal ions in the juice stain. Gowtham interjected, mentioning polyethylene glycol (PEG)
and dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactants in Ravi's product, confirming his knowledge. The
two of them embraced, impressed with each other's skills.</p>
<p>Their conversation was interrupted by Divya, who playfully sprayed a perfume bottle on
Gowtham's coat, changing the colour from black to blue. This surprised everyone around them.
Ravi, in a sarcastic tone, commented on Divya's show-off, and Divya responded with a playful
expression. Amidst the banter, Naresh revealed that the reason he had flipped his glass was
because of the butterfly drone. Gowtham immediately identified Vivek as the culprit behind
the drone's actions. Ravi and Divya expressed their determination to handle the situation.
Naresh assured them that they had already showcased their skills and now it was his turn to
take action. He took out his flip phone and used its scanning capabilities to detect the butterfly
drone's communication protocols. With a few taps on his phone, Naresh gained control over
the drone and made it perform loops of rapid ascents and descents until it eventually exploded.
Laughter filled the air as they celebrated their successful retaliation.After a satisfying dinner, as everyone started leaving the hall, Vivek and his friends Varun and Ritik approached Naresh, Gowtham, Divya, and Ravi, seeking retribution for the destruction of Vivek's drone. Tensions escalated, and a fight seemed imminent. However, just as things were about to escalate further, Vishnu Vardhan's voice echoed through the hall, commanding them to run as fast as they could if they wanted to avoid consequences. Without looking back,
Vivek and his friends sprinted towards their rooms, fearing the professor's wrath.</p>
<p>The voice resounded loudly, causing everyone to pause in their tracks. It posed a question,
asking if it should reveal something individually to each of them. Suddenly, Gowtham burst
into laughter, finding amusement in the situation. He complimented the device, acknowledging
its impressiveness but pointed out that its timing was off. As he spoke, Shreya emerged from
the darkness, her face concealed behind a metallic mask. With a sense of intrigue, she removed
the mask and questioned Gowtham, asking how he knew about her hidden identity. In response,
Gowtham proudly displayed his phone, which granted him access to all the security cameras
in the university. He specifically highlighted footage of Vishnu Sir walking near Block A.</p>
<p>At first, everyone was impressed by Shreya's masked appearance, but as they witnessed
Gowtham's hacking skills and his control over the security cameras, their reactions shifted to
awe. Smiles spread across their faces as they exchanged glances, realizing the incredible talents
within their group. They proceeded to walk together, moving slowly and confidently towards
their respective rooms.</p>
<p>Little did they know that the challenges they would encounter in the coming days would not
only test their scientific abilities but also their moral compass, their loyalty, and their ability to
keep secrets. The path they had chosen was fraught with danger and uncertainty, and the
choices they would make would have far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p>But for now, they allowed themselves a moment of anticipation, excitement, and camaraderie,
cherishing the memories of the day they first met—the day that would forever bind their fates
together and set them on a collision course with destiny.</p>
<p>The next chapter of their journey awaited, and with it, the unfolding of a mystery that would
grip them all, pushing them to their limits and forcing them to confront the darkness that lurked
within their own hearts</p>

<h3><strong>Chapter 3: Talent Over Luck</strong></h3>
<p>The sun began to rise, casting its golden rays upon the open hall as the participants gathered
once again, filled with anticipation for the start of the first round. They stood in organized lines,
their hearts pounding with excitement, ready to embark on the next phase of their journey.
Rama Prabha, radiating confidence and energy, took the centre stage once more. Her voice
echoed through the hall, commanding attention, and stirring a renewed sense of purpose within
each participant. She greeted them with a warm smile, exuding an air of determination and

<p>She emphasized the importance of teamwork and reminded them that the speed at which they
formed their teams would determine the time they had to work on their solutions.
"The formation of your teams’ rests solely on your shoulders," Rama Prabha stated firmly.
"This is an opportunity for you to leverage the connections you made during yesterday's dinner
and to understand your fellow participants. Remember, your success lies in your ability to come
together and collaborate effectively."</p>
<p>The participants listened attentively, realizing that their fate was in their own hands. They
understood that it was not luck but their own talent and determination that would determine

Shreya, the centre of attention the previous evening, approached him with a smile, and the two of them exchanged a nod of agreement, forming the foundation of their team.</p>
<p>Vivek, ever the opportunist, approached Gowtham, recognizing his leadership potential and
the benefits of aligning himself with a strong team. Naresh, observing from a distance, joined
them, realizing that his technical skills and attention to detail would complement the team's
strengths.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Divya and Ravi, the siblings who had entered the hall together, sought out
individuals whose talents and personalities would complement their own. Divya, with her sharp
intellect and strategic thinking, approached Vivek, recognizing his technical prowess. Ravi,
ever the observant one, Approached Madhu, a man who appeared to be twice his age, his
physique exuding strength and resilience. Despite his imposing presence, there was a distinct
air of serenity that surrounded him. Madhu's voice, in stark contrast to his physicality, resonated
with a gentle and soothing tone, conveying a sense of wisdom and tranquillity. During the
dinner, Madhu had displayed a remarkable ability to observe and absorb information,
demonstrating an astute eye for detail and a thoughtful nature. Together, they formed a team
that balanced intelligence, creativity, and meticulousness.</p>
<p>As the participants finalized their teams, the atmosphere in the hall buzzed with a sense of
purpose and determination. Friendships were forged, alliances were made, and a collective
energy permeated the air. Each team knew that their success depended not only on their
individual talents but also on their ability to work harmoniously as a unit.</p>
<p>With their teams in place, the participants eagerly awaited the announcement of their assigned
problems. Rama Prabha, sensing their anticipation, stepped forward once again, her voice filled
with excitement.</p>
<p>"Now that you have formed your teams, it is time to reveal the challenges that await you," she
declared. "Remember, these problems have been meticulously designed to test your scientific

<p>The participants, now unified in their teams and driven by a shared purpose, dispersed to begin
their work. The hall echoed with the sound of animated discussions, brainstorming sessions,
and the clatter of pens on paper as the teams delved into their assigned problems, determined
to find innovative solutions that would leave a lasting impact.And so, the first round of the SSP Club commenced—a test of intellect, creativity, and teamwork. The participants had embraced the notion that success was not a matter of luck but a result of their own talents and hard work. They were ready to push the boundaries of scientific exploration, confident that their solutions would captivate potential investors and pave the way for a brighter future.</p>
<p>The journey had just begun, and as they immersed themselves in their projects, they knew that

convergence of diverse skills, intellects, and personalities, each team a unique blend of
strengths and potential. Little did they know that their collaboration would unravel mysteries
beyond the realm of science.</p>
<p>As the teams delved into their assigned problems, an undercurrent of mystery began to weave
its way through their work. Clues and enigmatic patterns emerged, hinting at hidden
connections and secret agendas. The participants, driven by their insatiable curiosity, started
piecing together fragments of a larger puzzle, unaware of the mysteries that awaited them.
Meanwhile, an unknown force watched from the shadows, observing their every move. Unseen
eyes scrutinized their progress, silently analysing the depth of their intellect and the strength of
their determination. It seemed as though an intricate game was unfolding, where talent and
intuition would be pitted against the unpredictable whims of fate.</p>

<h3><strong>Chapter 4: What the Faludh!!!</strong></h3>
<p>Gowtham, Shreya, Vivek, Divya, and Naresh formed a team known as SNB, named after
Satyendra Nath Bose, the Indian mathematician and physicist who derived Planck's quantum
radiation law. On the other hand, Ravi, Madhu, Priya, Geethika, and Mrudulla named their
team MST, inspired by Meghnad Saha, the Indian astrophysicist who discovered the thermal
ionization equation. Both teams were eager to work on their respective problems and give their
best, hoping to overcome any challenges that lay ahead.</p>
<p>After receiving their problem codes, SNB and MST entered them into the specially designed
software provided by SSU. The software not only revealed the problem but also kept track of
their progress, provided a free source of materials, and allocated virtual money amounting to
200,000 INR. The teams could use this money to purchase materials online, with the added
advantage of gaining an advantage if they managed to spend as little as possible.</p>
<p>As the teams prepared to enter their codes, Priya from MST encountered a small hiccup. She
entered the code "SSU54O7" into the tablet, but nothing appeared on the screen. She tried twice
more, growing increasingly frustrated. Ravi, noticing her struggle, approached and examined
the code. He corrected it, realizing that the correct code was "SSU5407" with a zero instead of
the letter "o." When Priya entered the correct code, a message appeared on the screen, wishing
the team good luck. However, the message itself left the team puzzled and confused.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in SNB's team, Vivek took the code from Gowtham's hand and entered it into the
tablet. The code "SSU4399" yielded the same result as MST's code—an enigmatic "All the best
team" message. Vivek, mirroring the confused expression on Priya's face, could not help but
exclaim, "What the problem is?!" Divya, intrigued by the peculiar message, took the tablet and,
after a quick glance, uttered the words, "What the Faludh!!" The team members overheard the
name "Faludh" from the other team and realized that both SNB and MST had received the same
problem, just as Rama Prabha had mentioned.</p>
<p>SNB and MST gathered their belongings and sought out quiet places to discuss the problem.
MST found refuge in an old shed, while SNB settled in a random classroom. Each team was
determined to unravel the mystery of Faludh. Priya from MST voiced her suspicion, suggesting
that there might be a glitch in the software, resulting in an incomplete problem description.
However, Ravi, refusing to accept this explanation, believed that there was a hidden message
embedded in the message they received. Madhu, sitting calmly and observing the items in the
shed, caught Ravi's attention, but he too could not discern any hidden meaning. Mrudulla,
intrigued by Priya's theory, decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. She believed that the
best course of action was to confirm their suspicions by seeking assistance from the help desk.
Geethika, understanding Mrudulla's perspective, offered to accompany her on this quest for
answers. The two of them prepared to venture to the help desk, hoping to gain clarity on the
mysterious problem they had encountered.</p>
<p>Before Mrudulla and Geethika set off, Ravi, realizing the potential importance of the situation,
instructed Priya and Geethika to utilize their hacking skills to search the dark web for any
scientific projects or information related to "Faludh." He understood that the dark web held a
treasure trove of hidden knowledge and believed that Priya and Geethika's expertise would be
invaluable in uncovering any relevant information. With this task assigned, Priya and Geethika
focused their attention on the digital realm, preparing to dive into the depths of the dark web.As Priya and Geethika embarked on their search for information, Mrudulla nodded and
exchanged a knowing look with Geethika. It was clear that she trusted Geethika's abilities and
believed that they would uncover valuable insights to shed light on the enigma surrounding
"Faludh." With a sense of determination, Mrudulla directed her steps toward the help desk,
ready to engage in a conversation that could potentially unravel the mystery that had captivated
their team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, within the SNB team, the atmosphere was filled with lively discussions as they
delved into the meaning behind the enigmatic term "Faludh." Vivek, driven by his eagerness
and curiosity, passionately put forward his theory. He believed that "Faludh" could potentially
be the name of a renowned scientist who had left behind an unfinished masterpiece, waiting
for someone to carry on their work and bring it to completion. As Vivek shared his thoughts,
his eyes gleamed with excitement, and he couldn't help but feel a surge of pride when Shreya
immediately resonated with his perspective.</p>
<p>Shreya, with her own keen sense of adventure, saw the allure in solving an unfinished
invention. She recognized the unique opportunity presented to them, a chance to contribute to
the scientific world by adding the final pieces to a puzzle left behind by an unknown genius.
As she voiced her agreement with Vivek, her words carried a hint of determination and a touch
of awe. The air crackled with a sense of possibility, as if the team had stumbled upon a hidden
treasure waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>However, not all members of the SNB team were entirely convinced. Gowtham, known for his
rational thinking, raised an eyebrow and injected a hint of scepticism into the discussion. He
offered a wry smile as he challenged the team's interpretations, questioning whether "Faludh"
could be as straightforward as an unfinished invention. Divya and Naresh, however, remained
steadfast in their own theories, unwilling to let go of their alternative explanations.</p>
<p>Divya, with her sharp intellect, suggested that "Faludh" might be an allusion to an old space
vessel that carried out clandestine missions, its name shrouded in secrecy. She envisaged a
thrilling adventure, unravelling the mysteries of the universe and uncovering hidden truths that
lay within the vastness of space. Naresh, ever the enigmatic thinker, proposed an intriguing
idea that "Faludh" could be a covert code, signalling a top-secret mission known only to a select
few. His imagination soared as he pictured a world of espionage, where their team's scientific
pursuits would intertwine with the realm of international intrigue.</p>
<p>As Gowtham, Shreya, and Vivek exchanged amused glances, their sarcastic remarks filled the
air. They playfully acknowledged the wide range of theories presented by their teammates,
simultaneously expressing both amusement and admiration for their creativity. Deep down,
they respected Divya and Naresh's perspectives, understanding that their unique insights could
potentially hold the key to unlocking the true meaning behind "Faludh."</p>
<p>Despite the sarcasm that laced their words, Gowtham, Shreya, and Vivek recognized the value
in divergent thinking. They acknowledged that their teammates' interpretations, even if
seemingly far-fetched, could lead them to unexpected breakthroughs. After all, it was precisely
this diversity of thought that had brought them together as a team in the first place.</p>
<p>With their differing theories in mind, the SNB team found themselves at a momentary impasse.
Their tablet, the source of their problem, abruptly powered off, reminding them that they hadoverlooked an essential item in their welcome kit—the charger. Realizing the urgency of the
situation, Gowtham seized the opportunity to take charge and swiftly made up his mind.
"Alright, guys," Gowtham declared with a grin, "I'll head to the help desk and grab the charger
for our tablet. In the meantime, let us keep pondering the 'Faludh' mystery and see where our
collective imagination takes us."</p>
<p>With renewed determination, the SNB team dispersed, each member enveloped in their
thoughts, ready to explore new possibilities and venture further into the intriguing realm of
"Faludh." They understood that sarcasm aside, their unique perspectives and unwavering belief
in their theories might just hold the key to unravelling the secrets that lay hidden within the
problem they had been assigned.</p>
<p>By the time Gowtham reached the help desk, located in the ground floor of the SSU main
building, which was just a block away from the classroom where the SNB team was waiting,
he noticed Mrudulla waiting for a response. Their eyes met for a few seconds, and a subtle
tension filled the air. It was clear that they were acquainted with each other, but they remained
silent, maintaining a distance between them. Both of them waited patiently at their respective
counters, Gowtham collecting the charger without any issues.</p>
<p>As Mrudulla continued to wait, Gowtham couldn't help but wonder why he was lingering
around even after getting the charger. His curiosity piqued when he overheard the response that
Mrudulla received from the help desk. The staff confirmed that there was no glitch in the
software and clarified that "Faludh" was indeed their assigned problem. The realization struck
Gowtham that both teams had been given the same enigma to unravel. With a hint of
disappointment, Mrudulla turned back, making her way towards the old shed to share this
information with her team.</p>
<p>As Gowtham turned to leave the help desk area, someone abruptly rushed past him, causing
Mrudulla to lose her balance. Reacting quickly, Gowtham reached out and held her hand,
steadying her. Their eyes met again, and in that brief moment, they felt a connection, a
familiarity that hung between them. A tinge of awkwardness settled in the atmosphere as they
stood there, caught in each other's gaze. Mrudulla broke the silence with a soft "thank you,
Goonu," using Gowtham's nickname known only to a select few. Both of them felt the
discomfort and the unspoken tension that lingered between them, prompting them to let go of
each other's hand.</p>
<p>Once Mrudulla regained her balance, they started walking side by side, feeling the weight of
the unspoken words that seemed to fill the air around them. As they walked, a voice from the
crowd yelled, "Switch on the location and check the address! It's really hard to find." The words
sparked an idea within Gowtham and Mrudulla simultaneously. They both took out their
phones and began searching for a place called "Faludh," hoping to uncover some clue or
reference. However, their search yielded no specific results.</p>
<p>Gowtham took the lead and shared his conviction with Mrudulla, stating, "I strongly believe
that 'Faludh' is the name of a place. The question isn't about finding a solution; it's about finding
the problem itself." Mrudulla agreed, realizing that the only way to truly understand the
problem was to experience it firsthand. They both felt a sense of urgency and a belief that the
answer lay nearby. Without hesitation, they sprinted towards the library, their footsteps echoing
through the corridors. As they rushed past Rama Prabha and Vishnu Vardhan, the sight of theirdetermined faces brought a smile to Rama Prabha's lips. She murmured to Vishnu Vardhan, "I
think they've cracked it."</p>
<p>Reaching the library, Gowtham and Mrudulla requested old Mumbai maps from the librarian.
The librarian directed them to the old history section on the fourth floor, an area filled with
countless dusty bookshelves. The scent of aged paper and faded ink permeated the air, creating
an atmosphere reminiscent of an old person's room. With unspoken agreement, they split up
and scoured different history books, their fingers flipping through pages in a race against time.
Suddenly, they stumbled upon a map of Bombay from 1893, and their eyes widened with
excitement as they spotted a place called "Faludh Nagar." It was marked on the map, but they
discovered that the name had been changed in later years.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with exhilaration, Gowtham and Mrudulla instinctively embraced each other in
a moment of triumph. But as the realization of their actions sank in, they quickly broke apart,
their faces flushing with a mixture of excitement and embarrassment. An awkward silence hung
between them momentarily until Mrudulla gathered her thoughts and suggested, "I think we
need to inform our team about this discovery."</p>
<p>With a renewed sense of purpose, they understood that they had made significant progress in
deciphering the problem at hand. However, they were still unaware of the exact nature of the
challenge they were about to face. They sensed that their journey ahead would be filled with
thrilling adventures, obstacles, and unexpected twists. But armed with their newfound
knowledge and a deepening connection between them, Gowtham and Mrudulla knew that they
were ready to take on whatever lay ahead.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Chapter 5: No Body No Crime</strong></h3>
<p>As the group exited the theatre hall, Naresh's eyes darted towards a figure in the distance, and
he uttered in a low, suspicious tone, "Guys, we are not alone." Instantly, everyone turned their
heads to where Naresh pointed his finger.</p>
<p>Divya, unable to contain herself, blurted out, "Murderer!" Ravi quickly covered Divya's mouth
and cautioned her, "Shh, don't shout." Shreya focused her gaze on the direction the person was
moving and commented, "I think he's heading towards the pool." Divya, displaying her
innocence, chimed in, "Pool water is not good for bathing, especially at night." Annoyed
glances were exchanged among the group as they told Divya to be quiet. Divya mumbled under
her breath, "No one cares about health." Ravi then intervened, asking Shreya, "How can you
be so sure the person is male?" Shreya replied with a knowing smile, "According to homicide
studies in the USA, most murders are committed by men. I'm just going by the facts. And I'm
not being sexist, just stating the statistics." Gowtham interrupted, urging the group to focus,
"Can't you guys be serious right now? Let's follow that person." Shreya playfully responded,
"Him," and Ravi countered, "Her." Shreya then proposed a bet, offering her Range Rover to
Ravi for the next six months if she was wrong, and Ravi would give her Rahul's private
Instagram account and ask him to follow her if she was right. Divya perked up, exclaiming,
"You mean Rahul Chand has another Instagram account?" Ravi confirmed Divya's suspicion,
stating, "Yes." Shreya added, "We all saved Rahul during the scientific showdown, but
strangely, Ravi received all the credit." Ravi proudly asserted, "Because I saved him," but
quickly corrected himself, "I mean, I had the maximum contribution."</p>
<p>Shreya and Gowtham nodded in agreement, and Gowtham urged the group to continue towards
the pool. Everyone followed Gowtham's lead, stopping at the south gate of the pool.
They peered into the vast expanse, witnessing a serene environment bathed in a soft blue glow.
Suddenly, they saw someone approaching the pool, and a sound of something heavy being
dragged reached their ears along with the gentle lapping of waves. The person, standing at the
edge of the pool, startled everyone as they witnessed them toss a bag into the water, causing
ripples and splashes. Water droplets sprayed onto the person, creating an eerie scene. The
group's gaze shifted from the person to the pool, where they saw what appeared to be a
campaign storage bag. The same thought crossed their minds simultaneously: Could it be the
missing body? In that moment, Ravi's phone began to ring, playing Taylor Swift's famous song
"No Body, No Crime." Ravi hurriedly silenced his phone before anyone could notice. However,
Mrudulla, who was present by the pool, seemed to have heard the ringtone.</p>
<p>The pool fell into silence, and Mrudulla swiftly fled through the north entrance. Gowtham's
mind raced with questions and worries. He desperately wanted to open the bag and check its
contents, but the sound of the watchmen's approaching footsteps prevented them from doing
so. The group silently ran towards the west gate to exit the university. As they successfully
made their way out, a sense of relief washed over them. However, each member of the group
carried their own doubts and questions. Gowtham, unable to shake off his concerns, still felt
the urge to go back and examine the bag. In a tone filled with worry and helplessness, he
muttered to himself, "It can't be... It can't be." Shreya, curious about his statement, asked
Gowtham, "What can't it be?" Gowtham hesitated for a moment and then responded,
"Mrudulla..." Shreya looked at him skeptically. Before she could respond, Naresh interjected,
suggesting that they should all return to their rooms. He believed that the events they hadwitnessed went far beyond what had occurred in Faludh. Ravi added, "If this is really bigger
than Faludh, then we have no chance of escaping it."</p>

The sun was going down, and the sky turned orange and purple. All around, people hurried home, street vendors packed up, and cars honked in traffic. In the middle of this rush stood \u003cstrong\u003eSarasvati Siksha University (SSU)\u003c/strong\u003e, a place where students studied hard and hoped for a bright future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham, a young man with a restless spirit, found himself in the dimly lit depths of the\nuniversity’s car park. As he sat in his car, the world outside faded into obscurity, shielding him\nfrom the clamour of Mumbai's relentless energy. Lost in his thoughts, he was startled by the\nshrill ring of his phone. Its screen displayed the name 'Ravi,' and without hesitation, Gowtham\nanswered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e'I am coming, give me ten minutes,' Gowtham replied hurriedly, his voice laced with urgency.\nRavi's terse response, 'Come fast, we need to move the body,' sent a chill down Gowtham's\nspine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith nimble fingers, Gowtham accessed a clandestine app on his phone, an indispensable tool\nthat granted him control over the college's security systems. A swift click of a switch button\nwithin the app triggered a notification, 'Car park access granted.' The gates groaned open,\nallowing him passage. Exiting his car, Gowtham sprinted toward the door, his eyes fixated on\nhis watch, the minutes ticking away relentlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the labyrinthine corridors, Gowtham navigated, his watch screen continuously\nswiped, as if trying to manipulate time itself. Finally, he arrived at a dimly lit location,\nilluminated only by feeble emergency lights scattered along the walls. The atmosphere was\nheavy with anticipation as Gowtham tapped his watch, causing a small red light to emanate,\naccompanied by a subtle beep. In the soft glow, a young woman emerged, her silhouette hinting\nat a familiar figure. Without hesitation, she rushed towards Gowtham, enveloping him in a tight\nembrace. It was Shreya, the object of Gowtham's affection. In that moment, their worlds\nconverged, offering solace amidst the turmoil that awaited them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, three more figures emerged from the shadows. Ravi, Divya, and Naresh, their faces\netched with a mixture of worry and trepidation. As Gowtham approached them, his voice\nstrained with concern, he called out to Ravi, demanding to know what had transpired. Divya\ninterjected, her words laced with theatrical flair, 'Murder,' she uttered with a hushed intensity,\nthe weight of the unknown heavy upon them. Immediately, Ravi interjected, casting doubt on\nDivya's assumption. \"We don't know yet,\" he replied with a hint of scepticism in his voice.\nDivya's retort came swiftly, laced with sarcasm. \"Oh, in what world does a person choose uni\ntheatre to die naturally?\" she quipped, her words dripping with irony. Ravi responded with a\nbemused look, silently acknowledging the absurdity of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity burned within him, and Gowtham pressed Ravi for an explanation on why he had\ndecided not to involve the police. The silence that followed spoke volumes, each member of\nthe group exchanging furtive glances. Suspicion gripped Gowtham, and he turned to Shreya,seeking answers. \"Shreya, what happened?\" he implored, his voice tinged with a mix of\nconcern and frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShreya hesitated for a moment, her gaze shifting between Gowtham and Ravi. Finally, she\nmustered the courage to speak. \"G, actually...\" Her voice trailed off, and she looked towards\nRavi, urging him to reveal the truth. Gowtham's gaze intensified, a flicker of anger creeping\ninto his voice. \"Ravi, you tell me, “He demanded, his tone laced with a sense of urgency.\nRavi began to mumble, struggling to find the right words. \"Actually, there was a knife... and\nfingerprints... and footprints...\" he managed to utter, his voice faltering. Divya's eyes narrowed\nas she locked her gaze onto Ravi, her accusatory tone cutting through the tension. \"It's your\nfault. Dad warned me about your irresponsible behaviour. You are going to drag us all down,\"\nshe asserted, her words seething with resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi's voice trembled as he responded, shocked by his sister's revelation. \"Did Dad really say\nthat?\" he whispered; his voice filled with disbelief. Divya's sarcastic smirk remained firmly in\nplace as she replied, \"More or less, the same meaning.\" Ravi's confusion deepened as he\nquestioned Divya's motives. \"If you knew I was trouble, why did you follow me?\" he asked,\nhis voice tinged with hurt. Divya's retort was swift and cutting. \"I wanted to know what you\nwere hiding,\" she stated firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi insisted, \"I didn't hide anything from you.\" Divya, undeterred, fired back, \"What about\nthe ice cream I left in the fridge? You ate it.\" Ravi's face contorted in disbelief. \"I didn't eat it.\nAsk Mom if you want,\" he protested. Divya, unyielding, shot back, \"Mom always supports\nyou. I know.\" Gowtham observed the exchange with a suspicious gaze, silently keeping his\nown secret about devouring the ice cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing impatient, Gowtham intervened, demanding clarity from the group. \"Come on, guys.\nCan someone please tell me what happened?\" Naresh, who had been silent until now, finally\nspoke up. \"I think we messed up,\" he confessed, his voice filled with a mixture of fear and\nguilt. \"I don't know what happened exactly, but I saw Ravi holding the knife next to the body.\"\nRavi interrupted, countering Naresh's claim. \"I saw Shreya holding the knife and entering the\ntheater hall,\" he insisted, his voice tinged with accusation. Shreya, frustration evident in her\ntone, interjected, \"For God's sake, how many times do I have to tell you? That was not a knife;\nit was my hair clip.\" Divya came in between and said, \"I didn't do anything, I just followed\nRavi.\" Everyone looked at Divya angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham silenced the heated exchange, his voice cutting through the tension. \"So, what are\nyou all trying to say?\" he asked, his gaze shifting between his friends. Naresh spoke up once\nagain, revealing a troubling truth. \"The whole dead body is covered in all four of our\nfingerprints and footprints,\" he confessed. \"If we inform anyone about it, no one is going to\ntrust us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Naresh was explaining their involvement, Divya attempted to speak up, but each time,\nsomeone interrupted her. Frustration building, she finally shouted, \"Guys, the dead body!\"\nEveryone turned their attention to Divya, eager to hear what she had to say. With a trembling\nvoice, she continued, \"The dead body is missing. “All eyes darted towards the spot where Divya\npointed, only to find an empty space. Surprisingly, there was no trace of the corpse, but the\nentire floor was splattered with blood. Panic gripped the group as they realized the evidencewas vanishing before their eyes. Ravi's hesitation to involve the police suddenly made sense to\nGowtham. Ravi frantically searched for the murder weapon, but it was nowhere to be found.\nHe understood that Ravi's reluctance was driven by their participation in the upcoming SSP\ncompetition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham and the rest joined the search, scouring every corner of the scene. The tension in the\nair was palpable as they desperately looked for any sign of the missing body or weapon. The\ndimly lit theatre hall added an eerie ambiance to the search, the shadows playing tricks on their\nminds. Each creaking sound and flickering light heightened their anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of the chaos, Divya's fear-stricken voice cut through, \"I think we should leave. It's\ngetting late, and we've spent too much time at the crime scene.\" Her suggestion hung in the air,\nand everyone contemplated the consequences of staying any longer. The fear of being caught,\nof the truth unravelling, weighed heavily on their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi pondered the situation and voiced his concern. \"What about our footprints? If there's no\nbody or weapon, our footprints will be the only evidence to file a case against us. We won't\nhave any proof to defend ourselves.\" Naresh, who had been quiet until now, spoke up with a\nmysterious tone, his voice filled with an unexpected suggestion. \"We should clean up the\nevidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi readily agreed, understanding the urgency of the situation. They couldn't afford to leave\nany trace behind, any shred of evidence that could link them to the crime. The group's collective\ndecision was made, acknowledging the risks they faced. They knew they had to clean up the\ncrime scene to eliminate any trace of their involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one, they retrieved cleaning tools from the theatre hall's storage room. Gowtham\ngrabbed a wet mop, its bristles dripping with water, while Ravi took a dry mop, ready to absorb\nany remaining stains. Naresh and Shreya armed themselves with cloths and cleaning spray,\ntheir determined expressions masked their fear. Divya, holding a dusting tool in her trembling\nhand, tried to keep up her composure amidst the chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the group assembled with their respective tools, Ravi could not resist a sarcastic remark\ndirected at Divya, trying to lighten the heavy atmosphere. \"What will you do with that?\" he\nasked, pointing at the dusting tool. Divya, despite the tension, retorted in the same sarcastic\ntone, a touch of dark humour in her voice, \"Sorry, brother, it's my first murder... I mean, the\nfirst murder I've ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a mixture of trepidation and determination, they set to work. The sound of mops sweeping\nacross the bloodstained floor echoed through the empty theatre hall. The pungent smell of\ncleaning chemicals mingled with the metallic scent of blood, creating an odd combination that\npermeated the air. Each member of the group scrubbed and wiped; their movements almost\nrobotic as they tried to erase any trace of their presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe task felt never-ending, the minutes stretching into hours as they meticulously cleaned the\nbloodstains, ensuring not a single spot remained. The intensity of their focus was unwavering,\nfuelled by the fear of discovery. Every sound, every creaking floorboard, sent a jolt of anxiety\nthrough their veins.As they continued their frantic efforts, a newfound sense of unity emerged among the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite their conflicting emotions and accusations, they had no choice but to rely on each other\nto escape the clutches of the impending doom. Each stroke of the mop, each spray of the\ncleaning solution, became a symbolic act of trust and solidarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minutes turned into hours, and exhaustion weighed heavily on their shoulders. Drops of\nsweat rolled down their foreheads, mixing with the remnants of blood on their faces. But they\npersisted, determined to leave no trace behind. The theatre hall slowly transformed from a\ncrime scene to a sterile, sanitized space, devoid of any evidence of their involvement.\nFinally, as the last remnants of blood were wiped away, a sense of relief washed over them.\nThey had done their best to clean up the mess they had unwittingly become a part of. But the\nunderlying unease remained, lingering like a shadow in the back of their minds. The missing\nbody, the vanishing evidence—it was a mystery they could not escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhausted and emotionally drained, they gathered their cleaning tools, careful to leave no trace\nof their presence behind. As they prepared to leave the theatre hall, the weight of their actions\nsettled upon them. They had tampered with a crime scene, hidden the truth, and embarked on\na dangerous path. The consequences of their choices loomed over them, threatening to unravel\ntheir lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith heavy hearts, they made their way out of the theatre hall, each step filled with uncertainty.\nThe darkness of the night outside mirrored the uncertainty that now engulfed their lives. They\nhad crossed a line, and there was no turning back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they dispersed into the night, the events of that evening remained etched in their minds. The\nmurder, the missing body, the collective decision to clean up the evidence—they were bound\ntogether by secrets and guilt. The mystery had just begun, and they were entangled in a web of\nintrigue and danger that would test their loyalty and resilience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did they know that their actions had set in motion a series of events that would lead them\ndeeper into the darkness, unravelling a web of secrets and lies that would threaten not only\ntheir friendships but also their very lives. The truth was out there, waiting to be discovered, and\nthey were about to embark on a journey that would change everything they thought they knew.\nAnd so, with hearts heavy and minds filled with anticipation, they stepped into the unknown,\nready to face the consequences of their actions and delve deeper into the intricate puzzle of the\nfirst murder they had ever encountered. The game had just begun, and the stakes were higher\nthan they could have ever imagined\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 2: The Day We Met\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect crimes may seem flawless as long as they remain secret. However, even the most\nmeticulously planned schemes could unravel if those involved fail to remain silent in times of\nadversity. Now, the question arises: can these five individuals truly keep their secret?

Only five of these\nstudents would secure a coveted spot in the club, entitling them to a scholarship that would\noffer them to study in any top universities like Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and Stanford.\nFurthermore, these fortunate individuals would also have the unique opportunity to contribute\nto India's esteemed defence project, Kavach, working closely with the national government.\nHowever, gaining a spot in the top five required successfully navigating three rounds of\nrigorous selection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Announcement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun cast a warm glow over the sprawling campus of Sarasvati Siksha University (SSU),\nan institution steeped in history and renowned for its rich academic tradition.

Anticipation and nervous energy filled the atmosphere,\ncreating a palpable buzz. However, the sudden interruption of Dr Vishnu Vardhan, the\npsychology professor, brought an immediate hush over the room. Dr Vardhan, a commanding\npresence with his tall stature, broad shoulders, and muscular build, stepped forward, casting a\nshadow of silence over the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, everyone,\" Dr Vardhan announced, his voice cutting through the noise. \"The\ncompetition has been cancelled.\" A wave of surprise and disappointment washed over the\nparticipants as they turned their attention to the professor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr Vardhan, wearing a peculiar smile, continued, \"But let me tell you, this statement can be\ntrue for anyone of you at any moment if I catch you making any mistakes.\" He paused for a\nmoment, letting his words sink in. \"I will share an interesting quote that might give you clarity\nabout your stay here for the next nine months: 'For surviving a hundred times, you need to be\nlucky a hundred times. But to die, you just need to be unlucky once.'\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words hung heavy in the air, and the room fell into a contemplative silence. Dr Vardhan's\ngaze swept across the room as he continued, \"SSU is not here to make your individual futures\nbright; that responsibility lies with your parents. We are here to make the world bright, and for\nthat, I will not hesitate to push you all into the darkness. I know some of you might think I am\na sadist, questioning how one's behaviour can be used to judge their talent. But believe me, I\nam much more than what you think. This is an opportunity that has the power to change your\nlives. So, limit your actions, not your thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weight of Dr Vardhan's words settled upon the participants, leaving them with a mix of\nuncertainty and determination. They understood that their journey at SSU would be\nchallenging, and that success would require more than just scientific knowledge and skills.\nDr Vishnu Vardhan concluded by reminding everyone to dress appropriately and join the\ndinner, emphasizing the importance of maintaining good behaviour throughout the evening.The evening arrived, and one by one, the participants made their way into the hall around 7:00\nPM. Among the crowd, a lady dressed in a stunning red long dress caught everyone's attention.\nIt was none other than Shreya, who seemed to have a group of admirers following her every\nmove. On the other hand, Naresh, the unnoticed figure, entered the hall in an old suit that looked\nolder than the university itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Shreya became the centre of attention, male students like Gowtham and Vivek engaged\nin a silent competition to impress the female students. Gowtham, dressed impeccably as a\ngentleman, caught the eyes of many, but he seemed disinterested in the beauty competition\nunfolding before him. Instead, he quietly sipped a fruit punch in a corner. Vivek, on the other\nhand, was determined to eliminate his competitors before the start of the first round. He took\nout a small butterfly drone from his pocket and set it flying. Using his smartwatch, Vivek\nmaneuverer the drone to fly directly over the students' eyes, causing them to drop their drinks\nonto the professor. Vishnu Vardhan, known for his observant nature, noticed the students'\nactions but did not respond immediately, silently adding their names to his list of potential\ntroublemakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing frustrated, Vivek decided to take his actions further and directly target Vishnu\nVardhan. He directed the butterfly drone to fly over Naresh as he was about to pass by Vishnu\nVardhan. Vivek pressed the up arrow on his watch, causing the drone to fly high into the air,\nand then adjusted its angle to make it swoop down towards Naresh. As the butterfly flew over\nNaresh's eyes, he shook and accidentally flipped his juice glass. However, Gowtham, who\nhappened to be standing between Naresh and Vishnu Vardhan, shielded the professor from the\nflying juice, causing it to land on Gowtham instead. Vishnu Vardhan felt the impact and saw\nthe juice stains on Gowtham's coat, leading him to take notice of Naresh's involvement.\nJust as Vishnu Vardhan was about to confront Gowtham, a mysterious man in a black suit, long\nhair, and a trimmed beard approached them. He placed his hand on Gowtham's shoulder,\nturning him around, and discreetly sprayed something on Gowtham's coat. When Gowtham\nfinally turned to face Vishnu Vardhan, the professor was surprised to find no trace of juice\nstains on the coat. Intrigued, Vishnu Vardhan left the scene, leaving Gowtham and Naresh\nrelieved. They looked at the man in gratitude and curiosity, asking how he managed to remove\nthe stains and who he was. The man introduced himself as Ravi and explained that he used his\n\"Vanish Spray,\" which contained ethyl alcohol and chelating agents to break down and remove\nthe metal ions in the juice stain. Gowtham interjected, mentioning polyethylene glycol (PEG)\nand dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactants in Ravi's product, confirming his knowledge. The\ntwo of them embraced, impressed with each other's skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir conversation was interrupted by Divya, who playfully sprayed a perfume bottle on\nGowtham's coat, changing the colour from black to blue. This surprised everyone around them.\nRavi, in a sarcastic tone, commented on Divya's show-off, and Divya responded with a playful\nexpression. Amidst the banter, Naresh revealed that the reason he had flipped his glass was\nbecause of the butterfly drone. Gowtham immediately identified Vivek as the culprit behind\nthe drone's actions. Ravi and Divya expressed their determination to handle the situation.\nNaresh assured them that they had already showcased their skills and now it was his turn to\ntake action. He took out his flip phone and used its scanning capabilities to detect the butterfly\ndrone's communication protocols. With a few taps on his phone, Naresh gained control over\nthe drone and made it perform loops of rapid ascents and descents until it eventually exploded.\nLaughter filled the air as they celebrated their successful retaliation.After a satisfying dinner, as everyone started leaving the hall, Vivek and his friends Varun and Ritik approached Naresh, Gowtham, Divya, and Ravi, seeking retribution for the destruction of Vivek's drone. Tensions escalated, and a fight seemed imminent. However, just as things were about to escalate further, Vishnu Vardhan's voice echoed through the hall, commanding them to run as fast as they could if they wanted to avoid consequences. Without looking back,\nVivek and his friends sprinted towards their rooms, fearing the professor's wrath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice resounded loudly, causing everyone to pause in their tracks. It posed a question,\nasking if it should reveal something individually to each of them. Suddenly, Gowtham burst\ninto laughter, finding amusement in the situation. He complimented the device, acknowledging\nits impressiveness but pointed out that its timing was off. As he spoke, Shreya emerged from\nthe darkness, her face concealed behind a metallic mask. With a sense of intrigue, she removed\nthe mask and questioned Gowtham, asking how he knew about her hidden identity. In response,\nGowtham proudly displayed his phone, which granted him access to all the security cameras\nin the university. He specifically highlighted footage of Vishnu Sir walking near Block A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, everyone was impressed by Shreya's masked appearance, but as they witnessed\nGowtham's hacking skills and his control over the security cameras, their reactions shifted to\nawe. Smiles spread across their faces as they exchanged glances, realizing the incredible talents\nwithin their group. They proceeded to walk together, moving slowly and confidently towards\ntheir respective rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did they know that the challenges they would encounter in the coming days would not\nonly test their scientific abilities but also their moral compass, their loyalty, and their ability to\nkeep secrets.

On the other hand, Ravi, Madhu, Priya, Geethika, and Mrudulla named their\nteam MST, inspired by Meghnad Saha, the Indian astrophysicist who discovered the thermal\nionization equation. Both teams were eager to work on their respective problems and give their\nbest, hoping to overcome any challenges that lay ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter receiving their problem codes, SNB and MST entered them into the specially designed\nsoftware provided by SSU. The software not only revealed the problem but also kept track of\ntheir progress, provided a free source of materials, and allocated virtual money amounting to\n200,000 INR. The teams could use this money to purchase materials online, with the added\nadvantage of gaining an advantage if they managed to spend as little as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the teams prepared to enter their codes, Priya from MST encountered a small hiccup. She\nentered the code \"SSU54O7\" into the tablet, but nothing appeared on the screen. She tried twice\nmore, growing increasingly frustrated. Ravi, noticing her struggle, approached and examined\nthe code. He corrected it, realizing that the correct code was \"SSU5407\" with a zero instead of\nthe letter \"o.\" When Priya entered the correct code, a message appeared on the screen, wishing\nthe team good luck. However, the message itself left the team puzzled and confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, in SNB's team, Vivek took the code from Gowtham's hand and entered it into the\ntablet. The code \"SSU4399\" yielded the same result as MST's code—an enigmatic \"All the best\nteam\" message. Vivek, mirroring the confused expression on Priya's face, could not help but\nexclaim, \"What the problem is?!\" Divya, intrigued by the peculiar message, took the tablet and,\nafter a quick glance, uttered the words, \"What the Faludh!!\" The team members overheard the\nname \"Faludh\" from the other team and realized that both SNB and MST had received the same\nproblem, just as Rama Prabha had mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSNB and MST gathered their belongings and sought out quiet places to discuss the problem.\nMST found refuge in an old shed, while SNB settled in a random classroom. Each team was\ndetermined to unravel the mystery of Faludh. Priya from MST voiced her suspicion, suggesting\nthat there might be a glitch in the software, resulting in an incomplete problem description.\nHowever, Ravi, refusing to accept this explanation, believed that there was a hidden message\nembedded in the message they received. Madhu, sitting calmly and observing the items in the\nshed, caught Ravi's attention, but he too could not discern any hidden meaning. Mrudulla,\nintrigued by Priya's theory, decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. She believed that the\nbest course of action was to confirm their suspicions by seeking assistance from the help desk.\nGeethika, understanding Mrudulla's perspective, offered to accompany her on this quest for\nanswers. The two of them prepared to venture to the help desk, hoping to gain clarity on the\nmysterious problem they had encountered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Mrudulla and Geethika set off, Ravi, realizing the potential importance of the situation,\ninstructed Priya and Geethika to utilize their hacking skills to search the dark web for any\nscientific projects or information related to \"Faludh.\" He understood that the dark web held a\ntreasure trove of hidden knowledge and believed that Priya and Geethika's expertise would be\ninvaluable in uncovering any relevant information. With this task assigned, Priya and Geethika\nfocused their attention on the digital realm, preparing to dive into the depths of the dark web.As Priya and Geethika embarked on their search for information, Mrudulla nodded and\nexchanged a knowing look with Geethika. It was clear that she trusted Geethika's abilities and\nbelieved that they would uncover valuable insights to shed light on the enigma surrounding\n\"Faludh.\" With a sense of determination, Mrudulla directed her steps toward the help desk,\nready to engage in a conversation that could potentially unravel the mystery that had captivated\ntheir team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, within the SNB team, the atmosphere was filled with lively discussions as they\ndelved into the meaning behind the enigmatic term \"Faludh.\" Vivek, driven by his eagerness\nand curiosity, passionately put forward his theory. He believed that \"Faludh\" could potentially\nbe the name of a renowned scientist who had left behind an unfinished masterpiece, waiting\nfor someone to carry on their work and bring it to completion. As Vivek shared his thoughts,\nhis eyes gleamed with excitement, and he couldn't help but feel a surge of pride when Shreya\nimmediately resonated with his perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShreya, with her own keen sense of adventure, saw the allure in solving an unfinished\ninvention. She recognized the unique opportunity presented to them, a chance to contribute to\nthe scientific world by adding the final pieces to a puzzle left behind by an unknown genius.\nAs she voiced her agreement with Vivek, her words carried a hint of determination and a touch\nof awe.

Gowtham, known for his\nrational thinking, raised an eyebrow and injected a hint of scepticism into the discussion. He\noffered a wry smile as he challenged the team's interpretations, questioning whether \"Faludh\"\ncould be as straightforward as an unfinished invention. Divya and Naresh, however, remained\nsteadfast in their own theories, unwilling to let go of their alternative explanations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDivya, with her sharp intellect, suggested that \"Faludh\" might be an allusion to an old space\nvessel that carried out clandestine missions, its name shrouded in secrecy. She envisaged a\nthrilling adventure, unravelling the mysteries of the universe and uncovering hidden truths that\nlay within the vastness of space. Naresh, ever the enigmatic thinker, proposed an intriguing\nidea that \"Faludh\" could be a covert code, signalling a top-secret mission known only to a select\nfew. His imagination soared as he pictured a world of espionage, where their team's scientific\npursuits would intertwine with the realm of international intrigue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gowtham, Shreya, and Vivek exchanged amused glances, their sarcastic remarks filled the\nair.

Realizing the urgency of the\nsituation, Gowtham seized the opportunity to take charge and swiftly made up his mind.\n\"Alright, guys,\" Gowtham declared with a grin, \"I'll head to the help desk and grab the charger\nfor our tablet. In the meantime, let us keep pondering the 'Faludh' mystery and see where our\ncollective imagination takes us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith renewed determination, the SNB team dispersed, each member enveloped in their\nthoughts, ready to explore new possibilities and venture further into the intriguing realm of\n\"Faludh.\" They understood that sarcasm aside, their unique perspectives and unwavering belief\nin their theories might just hold the key to unravelling the secrets that lay hidden within the\nproblem they had been assigned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Gowtham reached the help desk, located in the ground floor of the SSU main\nbuilding, which was just a block away from the classroom where the SNB team was waiting,\nhe noticed Mrudulla waiting for a response. Their eyes met for a few seconds, and a subtle\ntension filled the air. It was clear that they were acquainted with each other, but they remained\nsilent, maintaining a distance between them. Both of them waited patiently at their respective\ncounters, Gowtham collecting the charger without any issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mrudulla continued to wait, Gowtham couldn't help but wonder why he was lingering\naround even after getting the charger.

The staff confirmed that there was no glitch in the\nsoftware and clarified that \"Faludh\" was indeed their assigned problem. The realization struck\nGowtham that both teams had been given the same enigma to unravel. With a hint of\ndisappointment, Mrudulla turned back, making her way towards the old shed to share this\ninformation with her team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gowtham turned to leave the help desk area, someone abruptly rushed past him, causing\nMrudulla to lose her balance. Reacting quickly, Gowtham reached out and held her hand,\nsteadying her. Their eyes met again, and in that brief moment, they felt a connection, a\nfamiliarity that hung between them. A tinge of awkwardness settled in the atmosphere as they\nstood there, caught in each other's gaze. Mrudulla broke the silence with a soft \"thank you,\nGoonu,\" using Gowtham's nickname known only to a select few. Both of them felt the\ndiscomfort and the unspoken tension that lingered between them, prompting them to let go of\neach other's hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Mrudulla regained her balance, they started walking side by side, feeling the weight of\nthe unspoken words that seemed to fill the air around them. As they walked, a voice from the\ncrowd yelled, \"Switch on the location and check the address! It's really hard to find.\" The words\nsparked an idea within Gowtham and Mrudulla simultaneously. They both took out their\nphones and began searching for a place called \"Faludh,\" hoping to uncover some clue or\nreference. However, their search yielded no specific results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham took the lead and shared his conviction with Mrudulla, stating, \"I strongly believe\nthat 'Faludh' is the name of a place. The question isn't about finding a solution; it's about finding\nthe problem itself.\" Mrudulla agreed, realizing that the only way to truly understand the\nproblem was to experience it firsthand. They both felt a sense of urgency and a belief that the\nanswer lay nearby. Without hesitation, they sprinted towards the library, their footsteps echoing\nthrough the corridors. As they rushed past Rama Prabha and Vishnu Vardhan, the sight of theirdetermined faces brought a smile to Rama Prabha's lips. She murmured to Vishnu Vardhan, \"I\nthink they've cracked it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the library, Gowtham and Mrudulla requested old Mumbai maps from the librarian.\nThe librarian directed them to the old history section on the fourth floor, an area filled with\ncountless dusty bookshelves. The scent of aged paper and faded ink permeated the air, creating\nan atmosphere reminiscent of an old person's room. With unspoken agreement, they split up\nand scoured different history books, their fingers flipping through pages in a race against time.\nSuddenly, they stumbled upon a map of Bombay from 1893, and their eyes widened with\nexcitement as they spotted a place called \"Faludh Nagar.\" It was marked on the map, but they\ndiscovered that the name had been changed in later years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverwhelmed with exhilaration, Gowtham and Mrudulla instinctively embraced each other in\na moment of triumph. But as the realization of their actions sank in, they quickly broke apart,\ntheir faces flushing with a mixture of excitement and embarrassment. An awkward silence hung\nbetween them momentarily until Mrudulla gathered her thoughts and suggested, \"I think we\nneed to inform our team about this discovery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a renewed sense of purpose, they understood that they had made significant progress in\ndeciphering the problem at hand. However, they were still unaware of the exact nature of the\nchallenge they were about to face. They sensed that their journey ahead would be filled with\nthrilling adventures, obstacles, and unexpected twists. But armed with their newfound\nknowledge and a deepening connection between them, Gowtham and Mrudulla knew that they\nwere ready to take on whatever lay ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 5: No Body No Crime\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the group exited the theatre hall, Naresh's eyes darted towards a figure in the distance, and\nhe uttered in a low, suspicious tone, \"Guys, we are not alone.\" Instantly, everyone turned their\nheads to where Naresh pointed his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDivya, unable to contain herself, blurted out, \"Murderer!\" Ravi quickly covered Divya's mouth\nand cautioned her, \"Shh, don't shout.\" Shreya focused her gaze on the direction the person was\nmoving and commented, \"I think he's heading towards the pool.\" Divya, displaying her\ninnocence, chimed in, \"Pool water is not good for bathing, especially at night.\" Annoyed\nglances were exchanged among the group as they told Divya to be quiet. Divya mumbled under\nher breath, \"No one cares about health.\" Ravi then intervened, asking Shreya, \"How can you\nbe so sure the person is male?\" Shreya replied with a knowing smile, \"According to homicide\nstudies in the USA, most murders are committed by men. I'm just going by the facts. And I'm\nnot being sexist, just stating the statistics.\" Gowtham interrupted, urging the group to focus,\n\"Can't you guys be serious right now? Let's follow that person.\" Shreya playfully responded,\n\"Him,\" and Ravi countered, \"Her.\" Shreya then proposed a bet, offering her Range Rover to\nRavi for the next six months if she was wrong, and Ravi would give her Rahul's private\nInstagram account and ask him to follow her if she was right. Divya perked up, exclaiming,\n\"You mean Rahul Chand has another Instagram account?\" Ravi confirmed Divya's suspicion,\nstating, \"Yes.\" Shreya added, \"We all saved Rahul during the scientific showdown, but\nstrangely, Ravi received all the credit.\" Ravi proudly asserted, \"Because I saved him,\" but\nquickly corrected himself, \"I mean, I had the maximum contribution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShreya and Gowtham nodded in agreement, and Gowtham urged the group to continue towards\nthe pool. Everyone followed Gowtham's lead, stopping at the south gate of the pool.\nThey peered into the vast expanse, witnessing a serene environment bathed in a soft blue glow.\nSuddenly, they saw someone approaching the pool, and a sound of something heavy being\ndragged reached their ears along with the gentle lapping of waves. The person, standing at the\nedge of the pool, startled everyone as they witnessed them toss a bag into the water, causing\nripples and splashes. Water droplets sprayed onto the person, creating an eerie scene. The\ngroup's gaze shifted from the person to the pool, where they saw what appeared to be a\ncampaign storage bag. The same thought crossed their minds simultaneously: Could it be the\nmissing body? In that moment, Ravi's phone began to ring, playing Taylor Swift's famous song\n\"No Body, No Crime.\" Ravi hurriedly silenced his phone before anyone could notice. However,\nMrudulla, who was present by the pool, seemed to have heard the ringtone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pool fell into silence, and Mrudulla swiftly fled through the north entrance. Gowtham's\nmind raced with questions and worries. He desperately wanted to open the bag and check its\ncontents, but the sound of the watchmen's approaching footsteps prevented them from doing\nso. The group silently ran towards the west gate to exit the university. As they successfully\nmade their way out, a sense of relief washed over them. However, each member of the group\ncarried their own doubts and questions. Gowtham, unable to shake off his concerns, still felt\nthe urge to go back and examine the bag. In a tone filled with worry and helplessness, he\nmuttered to himself, \"It can't be... It can't be.\" Shreya, curious about his statement, asked\nGowtham, \"What can't it be?\" Gowtham hesitated for a moment and then responded,\n\"Mrudulla...\" Shreya looked at him skeptically. Before she could respond, Naresh interjected,\nsuggesting that they should all return to their rooms. He believed that the events they hadwitnessed went far beyond what had occurred in Faludh. Ravi added, \"If this is really bigger\nthan Faludh, then we have no chance of escaping it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"7:[\"$\",\"article\",null,{\"className\":\"prose prose-lg mx-auto py-16 px-4 max-w-3xl\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"text-4xl font-extrabold mb-4\",\"children\":\"MAD\"}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"text-sm text-gray-500 mb-8\",\"children\":\"5/19/2025\"}],[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"className\":\"prose prose-lg lg:prose-xl space-y-6 text-justify mx-auto\",\"style\":{\"textAlign\":\"justify\"},\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$15\"}}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"mt-12 flex justify-between text-indigo-600\"}],[\"$\",\"$L16\",null,{\"storyId\":\"MAD\"}]]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"viewport\",\"content\":\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"}]]\nb:null\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:{\"metadata\":[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"CSKN\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"CSKN Website\"}]],\"error\":null,\"digest\":\"$undefined\"}\ne:{\"metadata\":\"$14:metadata\",\"error\":null,\"digest\":\"$undefined\"}\n"])</script></body></html>
