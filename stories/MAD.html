Murder\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the busy city of Mumbai, life never stopped. The sun was going down, and the sky turned orange and purple. All around, people hurried home, street vendors packed up, and cars honked in traffic. In the middle of this rush stood \u003cstrong\u003eSarasvati Siksha University (SSU)\u003c/strong\u003e, a place where students studied hard and hoped for a bright future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham, a young man with a restless spirit, found himself in the dimly lit depths of the\nuniversity’s car park. As he sat in his car, the world outside faded into obscurity, shielding him\nfrom the clamour of Mumbai's relentless energy. Lost in his thoughts, he was startled by the\nshrill ring of his phone. Its screen displayed the name 'Ravi,' and without hesitation, Gowtham\nanswered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e'I am coming, give me ten minutes,' Gowtham replied hurriedly, his voice laced with urgency.\nRavi's terse response, 'Come fast, we need to move the body,' sent a chill down Gowtham's\nspine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith nimble fingers, Gowtham accessed a clandestine app on his phone, an indispensable tool\nthat granted him control over the college's security systems. A swift click of a switch button\nwithin the app triggered a notification, 'Car park access granted.' The gates groaned open,\nallowing him passage. Exiting his car, Gowtham sprinted toward the door, his eyes fixated on\nhis watch, the minutes ticking away relentlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the labyrinthine corridors, Gowtham navigated, his watch screen continuously\nswiped, as if trying to manipulate time itself. Finally, he arrived at a dimly lit location,\nilluminated only by feeble emergency lights scattered along the walls. The atmosphere was\nheavy with anticipation as Gowtham tapped his watch, causing a small red light to emanate,\naccompanied by a subtle beep. In the soft glow, a young woman emerged, her silhouette hinting\nat a familiar figure. Without hesitation, she rushed towards Gowtham, enveloping him in a tight\nembrace. It was Shreya, the object of Gowtham's affection. In that moment, their worlds\nconverged, offering solace amidst the turmoil that awaited them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, three more figures emerged from the shadows. Ravi, Divya, and Naresh, their faces\netched with a mixture of worry and trepidation. As Gowtham approached them, his voice\nstrained with concern, he called out to Ravi, demanding to know what had transpired. Divya\ninterjected, her words laced with theatrical flair, 'Murder,' she uttered with a hushed intensity,\nthe weight of the unknown heavy upon them. Immediately, Ravi interjected, casting doubt on\nDivya's assumption. \"We don't know yet,\" he replied with a hint of scepticism in his voice.\nDivya's retort came swiftly, laced with sarcasm. \"Oh, in what world does a person choose uni\ntheatre to die naturally?\" she quipped, her words dripping with irony. Ravi responded with a\nbemused look, silently acknowledging the absurdity of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity burned within him, and Gowtham pressed Ravi for an explanation on why he had\ndecided not to involve the police. The silence that followed spoke volumes, each member of\nthe group exchanging furtive glances. Suspicion gripped Gowtham, and he turned to Shreya,seeking answers. \"Shreya, what happened?\" he implored, his voice tinged with a mix of\nconcern and frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShreya hesitated for a moment, her gaze shifting between Gowtham and Ravi. Finally, she\nmustered the courage to speak. \"G, actually...\" Her voice trailed off, and she looked towards\nRavi, urging him to reveal the truth. Gowtham's gaze intensified, a flicker of anger creeping\ninto his voice. \"Ravi, you tell me, “He demanded, his tone laced with a sense of urgency.\nRavi began to mumble, struggling to find the right words. \"Actually, there was a knife... and\nfingerprints... and footprints...\" he managed to utter, his voice faltering. Divya's eyes narrowed\nas she locked her gaze onto Ravi, her accusatory tone cutting through the tension. \"It's your\nfault. Dad warned me about your irresponsible behaviour. You are going to drag us all down,\"\nshe asserted, her words seething with resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi's voice trembled as he responded, shocked by his sister's revelation. \"Did Dad really say\nthat?\" he whispered; his voice filled with disbelief. Divya's sarcastic smirk remained firmly in\nplace as she replied, \"More or less, the same meaning.\" Ravi's confusion deepened as he\nquestioned Divya's motives. \"If you knew I was trouble, why did you follow me?\" he asked,\nhis voice tinged with hurt. Divya's retort was swift and cutting. \"I wanted to know what you\nwere hiding,\" she stated firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi insisted, \"I didn't hide anything from you.\" Divya, undeterred, fired back, \"What about\nthe ice cream I left in the fridge? You ate it.\" Ravi's face contorted in disbelief. \"I didn't eat it.\nAsk Mom if you want,\" he protested. Divya, unyielding, shot back, \"Mom always supports\nyou.

Shreya, frustration evident in her\ntone, interjected, \"For God's sake, how many times do I have to tell you? That was not a knife;\nit was my hair clip.\" Divya came in between and said, \"I didn't do anything, I just followed\nRavi.\" Everyone looked at Divya angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham silenced the heated exchange, his voice cutting through the tension. \"So, what are\nyou all trying to say?\" he asked, his gaze shifting between his friends.

With a trembling\nvoice, she continued, \"The dead body is missing. “All eyes darted towards the spot where Divya\npointed, only to find an empty space. Surprisingly, there was no trace of the corpse, but the\nentire floor was splattered with blood. Panic gripped the group as they realized the evidencewas vanishing before their eyes. Ravi's hesitation to involve the police suddenly made sense to\nGowtham.

They couldn't afford to leave\nany trace behind, any shred of evidence that could link them to the crime. The group's collective\ndecision was made, acknowledging the risks they faced. They knew they had to clean up the\ncrime scene to eliminate any trace of their involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one, they retrieved cleaning tools from the theatre hall's storage room. Gowtham\ngrabbed a wet mop, its bristles dripping with water, while Ravi took a dry mop, ready to absorb\nany remaining stains.

Among the crowd, a lady dressed in a stunning red long dress caught everyone's attention.\nIt was none other than Shreya, who seemed to have a group of admirers following her every\nmove. On the other hand, Naresh, the unnoticed figure, entered the hall in an old suit that looked\nolder than the university itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Shreya became the centre of attention, male students like Gowtham and Vivek engaged\nin a silent competition to impress the female students. Gowtham, dressed impeccably as a\ngentleman, caught the eyes of many, but he seemed disinterested in the beauty competition\nunfolding before him. Instead, he quietly sipped a fruit punch in a corner. Vivek, on the other\nhand, was determined to eliminate his competitors before the start of the first round. He took\nout a small butterfly drone from his pocket and set it flying. Using his smartwatch, Vivek\nmaneuverer the drone to fly directly over the students' eyes, causing them to drop their drinks\nonto the professor. Vishnu Vardhan, known for his observant nature, noticed the students'\nactions but did not respond immediately, silently adding their names to his list of potential\ntroublemakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing frustrated, Vivek decided to take his actions further and directly target Vishnu\nVardhan. He directed the butterfly drone to fly over Naresh as he was about to pass by Vishnu\nVardhan. Vivek pressed the up arrow on his watch, causing the drone to fly high into the air,\nand then adjusted its angle to make it swoop down towards Naresh. As the butterfly flew over\nNaresh's eyes, he shook and accidentally flipped his juice glass. However, Gowtham, who\nhappened to be standing between Naresh and Vishnu Vardhan, shielded the professor from the\nflying juice, causing it to land on Gowtham instead. Vishnu Vardhan felt the impact and saw\nthe juice stains on Gowtham's coat, leading him to take notice of Naresh's involvement.\nJust as Vishnu Vardhan was about to confront Gowtham, a mysterious man in a black suit, long\nhair, and a trimmed beard approached them. He placed his hand on Gowtham's shoulder,\nturning him around, and discreetly sprayed something on Gowtham's coat. When Gowtham\nfinally turned to face Vishnu Vardhan, the professor was surprised to find no trace of juice\nstains on the coat. Intrigued, Vishnu Vardhan left the scene, leaving Gowtham and Naresh\nrelieved. They looked at the man in gratitude and curiosity, asking how he managed to remove\nthe stains and who he was. The man introduced himself as Ravi and explained that he used his\n\"Vanish Spray,\" which contained ethyl alcohol and chelating agents to break down and remove\nthe metal ions in the juice stain. Gowtham interjected, mentioning polyethylene glycol (PEG)\nand dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactants in Ravi's product, confirming his knowledge. The\ntwo of them embraced, impressed with each other's skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir conversation was interrupted by Divya, who playfully sprayed a perfume bottle on\nGowtham's coat, changing the colour from black to blue. This surprised everyone around them.\nRavi, in a sarcastic tone, commented on Divya's show-off, and Divya responded with a playful\nexpression. Amidst the banter, Naresh revealed that the reason he had flipped his glass was\nbecause of the butterfly drone. Gowtham immediately identified Vivek as the culprit behind\nthe drone's actions. Ravi and Divya expressed their determination to handle the situation.\nNaresh assured them that they had already showcased their skills and now it was his turn to\ntake action. He took out his flip phone and used its scanning capabilities to detect the butterfly\ndrone's communication protocols. With a few taps on his phone, Naresh gained control over\nthe drone and made it perform loops of rapid ascents and descents until it eventually exploded.\nLaughter filled the air as they celebrated their successful retaliation.After a satisfying dinner, as everyone started leaving the hall, Vivek and his friends Varun and Ritik approached Naresh, Gowtham, Divya, and Ravi, seeking retribution for the destruction of Vivek's drone. Tensions escalated, and a fight seemed imminent. However, just as things were about to escalate further, Vishnu Vardhan's voice echoed through the hall, commanding them to run as fast as they could if they wanted to avoid consequences. Without looking back,\nVivek and his friends sprinted towards their rooms, fearing the professor's wrath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice resounded loudly, causing everyone to pause in their tracks. It posed a question,\nasking if it should reveal something individually to each of them. Suddenly, Gowtham burst\ninto laughter, finding amusement in the situation. He complimented the device, acknowledging\nits impressiveness but pointed out that its timing was off. As he spoke, Shreya emerged from\nthe darkness, her face concealed behind a metallic mask. With a sense of intrigue, she removed\nthe mask and questioned Gowtham, asking how he knew about her hidden identity. In response,\nGowtham proudly displayed his phone, which granted him access to all the security cameras\nin the university. He specifically highlighted footage of Vishnu Sir walking near Block A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, everyone was impressed by Shreya's masked appearance, but as they witnessed\nGowtham's hacking skills and his control over the security cameras, their reactions shifted to\nawe. Smiles spread across their faces as they exchanged glances, realizing the incredible talents\nwithin their group. They proceeded to walk together, moving slowly and confidently towards\ntheir respective rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did they know that the challenges they would encounter in the coming days would not\nonly test their scientific abilities but also their moral compass, their loyalty, and their ability to\nkeep secrets.

Unseen\neyes scrutinized their progress, silently analysing the depth of their intellect and the strength of\ntheir determination. It seemed as though an intricate game was unfolding, where talent and\nintuition would be pitted against the unpredictable whims of fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 4: What the Faludh!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham, Shreya, Vivek, Divya, and Naresh formed a team known as SNB, named after\nSatyendra Nath Bose, the Indian mathematician and physicist who derived Planck's quantum\nradiation law. On the other hand, Ravi, Madhu, Priya, Geethika, and Mrudulla named their\nteam MST, inspired by Meghnad Saha, the Indian astrophysicist who discovered the thermal\nionization equation. Both teams were eager to work on their respective problems and give their\nbest, hoping to overcome any challenges that lay ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter receiving their problem codes, SNB and MST entered them into the specially designed\nsoftware provided by SSU. The software not only revealed the problem but also kept track of\ntheir progress, provided a free source of materials, and allocated virtual money amounting to\n200,000 INR. The teams could use this money to purchase materials online, with the added\nadvantage of gaining an advantage if they managed to spend as little as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the teams prepared to enter their codes, Priya from MST encountered a small hiccup. She\nentered the code \"SSU54O7\" into the tablet, but nothing appeared on the screen. She tried twice\nmore, growing increasingly frustrated. Ravi, noticing her struggle, approached and examined\nthe code. He corrected it, realizing that the correct code was \"SSU5407\" with a zero instead of\nthe letter \"o.\" When Priya entered the correct code, a message appeared on the screen, wishing\nthe team good luck. However, the message itself left the team puzzled and confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, in SNB's team, Vivek took the code from Gowtham's hand and entered it into the\ntablet. The code \"SSU4399\" yielded the same result as MST's code—an enigmatic \"All the best\nteam\" message. Vivek, mirroring the confused expression on Priya's face, could not help but\nexclaim, \"What the problem is?!\" Divya, intrigued by the peculiar message, took the tablet and,\nafter a quick glance, uttered the words, \"What the Faludh!!\" The team members overheard the\nname \"Faludh\" from the other team and realized that both SNB and MST had received the same\nproblem, just as Rama Prabha had mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSNB and MST gathered their belongings and sought out quiet places to discuss the problem.\nMST found refuge in an old shed, while SNB settled in a random classroom. Each team was\ndetermined to unravel the mystery of Faludh. Priya from MST voiced her suspicion, suggesting\nthat there might be a glitch in the software, resulting in an incomplete problem description.\nHowever, Ravi, refusing to accept this explanation, believed that there was a hidden message\nembedded in the message they received. Madhu, sitting calmly and observing the items in the\nshed, caught Ravi's attention, but he too could not discern any hidden meaning. Mrudulla,\nintrigued by Priya's theory, decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. She believed that the\nbest course of action was to confirm their suspicions by seeking assistance from the help desk.\nGeethika, understanding Mrudulla's perspective, offered to accompany her on this quest for\nanswers. The two of them prepared to venture to the help desk, hoping to gain clarity on the\nmysterious problem they had encountered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Mrudulla and Geethika set off, Ravi, realizing the potential importance of the situation,\ninstructed Priya and Geethika to utilize their hacking skills to search the dark web for any\nscientific projects or information related to \"Faludh.\" He understood that the dark web held a\ntreasure trove of hidden knowledge and believed that Priya and Geethika's expertise would be\ninvaluable in uncovering any relevant information. With this task assigned, Priya and Geethika\nfocused their attention on the digital realm, preparing to dive into the depths of the dark web.As Priya and Geethika embarked on their search for information, Mrudulla nodded and\nexchanged a knowing look with Geethika. It was clear that she trusted Geethika's abilities and\nbelieved that they would uncover valuable insights to shed light on the enigma surrounding\n\"Faludh.\" With a sense of determination, Mrudulla directed her steps toward the help desk,\nready to engage in a conversation that could potentially unravel the mystery that had captivated\ntheir team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, within the SNB team, the atmosphere was filled with lively discussions as they\ndelved into the meaning behind the enigmatic term \"Faludh.\" Vivek, driven by his eagerness\nand curiosity, passionately put forward his theory. He believed that \"Faludh\" could potentially\nbe the name of a renowned scientist who had left behind an unfinished masterpiece, waiting\nfor someone to carry on their work and bring it to completion. As Vivek shared his thoughts,\nhis eyes gleamed with excitement, and he couldn't help but feel a surge of pride when Shreya\nimmediately resonated with his perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShreya, with her own keen sense of adventure, saw the allure in solving an unfinished\ninvention. She recognized the unique opportunity presented to them, a chance to contribute to\nthe scientific world by adding the final pieces to a puzzle left behind by an unknown genius.\nAs she voiced her agreement with Vivek, her words carried a hint of determination and a touch\nof awe. The air crackled with a sense of possibility, as if the team had stumbled upon a hidden\ntreasure waiting to be discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, not all members of the SNB team were entirely convinced. Gowtham, known for his\nrational thinking, raised an eyebrow and injected a hint of scepticism into the discussion. He\noffered a wry smile as he challenged the team's interpretations, questioning whether \"Faludh\"\ncould be as straightforward as an unfinished invention. Divya and Naresh, however, remained\nsteadfast in their own theories, unwilling to let go of their alternative explanations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDivya, with her sharp intellect, suggested that \"Faludh\" might be an allusion to an old space\nvessel that carried out clandestine missions, its name shrouded in secrecy. She envisaged a\nthrilling adventure, unravelling the mysteries of the universe and uncovering hidden truths that\nlay within the vastness of space. Naresh, ever the enigmatic thinker, proposed an intriguing\nidea that \"Faludh\" could be a covert code, signalling a top-secret mission known only to a select\nfew. His imagination soared as he pictured a world of espionage, where their team's scientific\npursuits would intertwine with the realm of international intrigue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gowtham, Shreya, and Vivek exchanged amused glances, their sarcastic remarks filled the\nair. They playfully acknowledged the wide range of theories presented by their teammates,\nsimultaneously expressing both amusement and admiration for their creativity. Deep down,\nthey respected Divya and Naresh's perspectives, understanding that their unique insights could\npotentially hold the key to unlocking the true meaning behind \"Faludh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the sarcasm that laced their words, Gowtham, Shreya, and Vivek recognized the value\nin divergent thinking. They acknowledged that their teammates' interpretations, even if\nseemingly far-fetched, could lead them to unexpected breakthroughs. After all, it was precisely\nthis diversity of thought that had brought them together as a team in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith their differing theories in mind, the SNB team found themselves at a momentary impasse.\nTheir tablet, the source of their problem, abruptly powered off, reminding them that they hadoverlooked an essential item in their welcome kit—the charger. Realizing the urgency of the\nsituation, Gowtham seized the opportunity to take charge and swiftly made up his mind.\n\"Alright, guys,\" Gowtham declared with a grin, \"I'll head to the help desk and grab the charger\nfor our tablet. In the meantime, let us keep pondering the 'Faludh' mystery and see where our\ncollective imagination takes us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith renewed determination, the SNB team dispersed, each member enveloped in their\nthoughts, ready to explore new possibilities and venture further into the intriguing realm of\n\"Faludh.\" They understood that sarcasm aside, their unique perspectives and unwavering belief\nin their theories might just hold the key to unravelling the secrets that lay hidden within the\nproblem they had been assigned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Gowtham reached the help desk, located in the ground floor of the SSU main\nbuilding, which was just a block away from the classroom where the SNB team was waiting,\nhe noticed Mrudulla waiting for a response. Their eyes met for a few seconds, and a subtle\ntension filled the air. It was clear that they were acquainted with each other, but they remained\nsilent, maintaining a distance between them. Both of them waited patiently at their respective\ncounters, Gowtham collecting the charger without any issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mrudulla continued to wait, Gowtham couldn't help but wonder why he was lingering\naround even after getting the charger. His curiosity piqued when he overheard the response that\nMrudulla received from the help desk. The staff confirmed that there was no glitch in the\nsoftware and clarified that \"Faludh\" was indeed their assigned problem. The realization struck\nGowtham that both teams had been given the same enigma to unravel. With a hint of\ndisappointment, Mrudulla turned back, making her way towards the old shed to share this\ninformation with her team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gowtham turned to leave the help desk area, someone abruptly rushed past him, causing\nMrudulla to lose her balance. Reacting quickly, Gowtham reached out and held her hand,\nsteadying her. Their eyes met again, and in that brief moment, they felt a connection, a\nfamiliarity that hung between them. A tinge of awkwardness settled in the atmosphere as they\nstood there, caught in each other's gaze. Mrudulla broke the silence with a soft \"thank you,\nGoonu,\" using Gowtham's nickname known only to a select few. Both of them felt the\ndiscomfort and the unspoken tension that lingered between them, prompting them to let go of\neach other's hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Mrudulla regained her balance, they started walking side by side, feeling the weight of\nthe unspoken words that seemed to fill the air around them. As they walked, a voice from the\ncrowd yelled, \"Switch on the location and check the address! It's really hard to find.\" The words\nsparked an idea within Gowtham and Mrudulla simultaneously. They both took out their\nphones and began searching for a place called \"Faludh,\" hoping to uncover some clue or\nreference. However, their search yielded no specific results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham took the lead and shared his conviction with Mrudulla, stating, \"I strongly believe\nthat 'Faludh' is the name of a place. The question isn't about finding a solution; it's about finding\nthe problem itself.\" Mrudulla agreed, realizing that the only way to truly understand the\nproblem was to experience it firsthand. They both felt a sense of urgency and a belief that the\nanswer lay nearby. Without hesitation, they sprinted towards the library, their footsteps echoing\nthrough the corridors. As they rushed past Rama Prabha and Vishnu Vardhan, the sight of theirdetermined faces brought a smile to Rama Prabha's lips. She murmured to Vishnu Vardhan, \"I\nthink they've cracked it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the library, Gowtham and Mrudulla requested old Mumbai maps from the librarian.\nThe librarian directed them to the old history section on the fourth floor, an area filled with\ncountless dusty bookshelves. The scent of aged paper and faded ink permeated the air, creating\nan atmosphere reminiscent of an old person's room. With unspoken agreement, they split up\nand scoured different history books, their fingers flipping through pages in a race against time.\nSuddenly, they stumbled upon a map of Bombay from 1893, and their eyes widened with\nexcitement as they spotted a place called \"Faludh Nagar.\" It was marked on the map, but they\ndiscovered that the name had been changed in later years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverwhelmed with exhilaration, Gowtham and Mrudulla instinctively embraced each other in\na moment of triumph. But as the realization of their actions sank in, they quickly broke apart,\ntheir faces flushing with a mixture of excitement and embarrassment. An awkward silence hung\nbetween them momentarily until Mrudulla gathered her thoughts and suggested, \"I think we\nneed to inform our team about this discovery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a renewed sense of purpose, they understood that they had made significant progress in\ndeciphering the problem at hand. However, they were still unaware of the exact nature of the\nchallenge they were about to face. They sensed that their journey ahead would be filled with\nthrilling adventures, obstacles, and unexpected twists.

Divya mumbled under\nher breath, \"No one cares about health.\" Ravi then intervened, asking Shreya, \"How can you\nbe so sure the person is male?\" Shreya replied with a knowing smile, \"According to homicide\nstudies in the USA, most murders are committed by men. I'm just going by the facts. And I'm\nnot being sexist, just stating the statistics.\" Gowtham interrupted, urging the group to focus,\n\"Can't you guys be serious right now? Let's follow that person.\" Shreya playfully responded,\n\"Him,\" and Ravi countered, \"Her.\" Shreya then proposed a bet, offering her Range Rover to\nRavi for the next six months if she was wrong, and Ravi would give her Rahul's private\nInstagram account and ask him to follow her if she was right. Divya perked up, exclaiming,\n\"You mean Rahul Chand has another Instagram account?\" Ravi confirmed Divya's suspicion,\nstating, \"Yes.\" Shreya added, \"We all saved Rahul during the scientific showdown, but\nstrangely, Ravi received all the credit.\" Ravi proudly asserted, \"Because I saved him,\" but\nquickly corrected himself, \"I mean, I had the maximum contribution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShreya and Gowtham nodded in agreement, and Gowtham urged the group to continue towards\nthe pool. Everyone followed Gowtham's lead, stopping at the south gate of the pool.\nThey peered into the vast expanse, witnessing a serene environment bathed in a soft blue glow.\nSuddenly, they saw someone approaching the pool, and a sound of something heavy being\ndragged reached their ears along with the gentle lapping of waves. The person, standing at the\nedge of the pool, startled everyone as they witnessed them toss a bag into the water, causing\nripples and splashes. Water droplets sprayed onto the person, creating an eerie scene. The\ngroup's gaze shifted from the person to the pool, where they saw what appeared to be a\ncampaign storage bag. The same thought crossed their minds simultaneously: Could it be the\nmissing body? In that moment, Ravi's phone began to ring, playing Taylor Swift's famous song\n\"No Body, No Crime.\" Ravi hurriedly silenced his phone before anyone could notice. However,\nMrudulla, who was present by the pool, seemed to have heard the ringtone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pool fell into silence, and Mrudulla swiftly fled through the north entrance. Gowtham's\nmind raced with questions and worries. He desperately wanted to open the bag and check its\ncontents, but the sound of the watchmen's approaching footsteps prevented them from doing\nso. The group silently ran towards the west gate to exit the university. As they successfully\nmade their way out, a sense of relief washed over them. However, each member of the group\ncarried their own doubts and questions. Gowtham, unable to shake off his concerns, still felt\nthe urge to go back and examine the bag. In a tone filled with worry and helplessness, he\nmuttered to himself, \"It can't be... It can't be.\" Shreya, curious about his statement, asked\nGowtham, \"What can't it be?\" Gowtham hesitated for a moment and then responded,\n\"Mrudulla...\" Shreya looked at him skeptically. Before she could respond, Naresh interjected,\nsuggesting that they should all return to their rooms. He believed that the events they hadwitnessed went far beyond what had occurred in Faludh. Ravi added, \"If this is really bigger\nthan Faludh, then we have no chance of escaping it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eNext chapter will come next week\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/backcover.png\" alt=\"BackCover\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"7:[\"$\",\"article\",null,{\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"py-20 px-4\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"text-4xl font-extrabold text-center mb-8\",\"children\":\"MAD\"}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mb-12\",\"children\":\"5/19/2025\"}],[\"$\",\"$L15\",null,{\"contentHtml\":\"$16\",\"width\":600,\"height\":800}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"mt-12\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"$L17\",null,{\"storyId\":\"MAD\"}]}]]}]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"viewport\",\"content\":\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"}]]\nb:null\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:{\"metadata\":[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"CSKN\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"CSKN Website\"}]],\"error\":null,\"digest\":\"$undefined\"}\ne:{\"metadata\":\"$14:metadata\",\"error\":null,\"digest\":\"$undefined\"}\n"])</script></body></html>
